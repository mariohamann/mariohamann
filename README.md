# üëã Hi!

I'm Mario from Freiburg, Germany. I studied to be a teacher for Music, German and Math, but work as Principal Engineer and Design System Architect at [Virtual Identity AG](https://www.virtual-identity.com/).

## üéØ Focus

I have a passion to work at the intersection of design and development. One result of that is my work on design systems:

-   [Synergy](https://github.com/synergy-design-system/synergy-design-system) for [SICK AG](https://www.sick.com)
-   [Solid](https://github.com/solid-design-system/solid) for [Union Investment](https://www.union-investment.de)

## üß™ Experiments

          For the third year in a row I'm reducing my amount of eating meat (="meating"?) to max. 6 times a year. In addition, I decided to add another resolution: Doing fitness training in any form min. 5 times a week.

          While the first intent came from environmental and ethical reasons, the second one came from feeling unhealthy and the fear of letting my body degrade. Having a family, I decided to work against that – and to put some external pressure on it, I did two things:
          1. I bought an Apple Watch and told everyone, that I'll sell it, as soon as I missed my exercise goals.
          2. I made a bet with my colleague Philipp: The person who loses it, has to make lunch for the other one for one week.

          The bet helped me to make the rules more concrete:
          1. Sick days reduce the goal in a week, vacations don't.
          2. Explicit workouts (no cycling or walking).
          3. Making an exercise in the morning and one in the evening counts as two times.
          4. Additional exercises in one week are not transferrable to the next.

          ## Idea
          The possession of my Apple Watch in a way indicated, if I'm on a track. But for my bet with Philipp after some time I wanted to make my progress more transparent. I decided to build a web component, which mimics the look and feel of GitHub's contribution graph. To be honest – I totally underestimated the project. Fighting with tables, and dates at the same time, while trying to do things as flexible and accessible as possible was more time consuming than expected – yes, even with the backing of LLMs.

          ## Result
          The end result is a reusable web component with zero dependencies:
      type: set_markdown
      enabled: true
    - id: lt8wc4c6
      code: |-
          <activity-graph
          	class="not-prose"
              range-start="2024-01-01"
              range-end="2024-12-31"
              activity-data="{{ aggregated_trainings }}"
              activity-levels="0,1,2"
          	first-day-of-week="1"
          	i18n='{"less":"Less (0)","more":"More (>1)"}'
          ></activity-graph>
      type: set_code
      enabled: true
    - id: ltdjm4s4
      markdown: |-
          - It allows you to set the visible date range, custom levels, your data and the first day of the week. 
          - For i18n you can localize the dates and override the labels.
          - For a11y I bet on semantics (`figure`, `figcaption`, `table`, `th` with `colspan` and `scope`) and `aria-hidden` combined with `sr-only`.
          - It includes a light and dark theme, optional auto theming, easy scaling, overridable CSS variables and default scrolling behaviour (which – in combination with the table – drove me crazy!)

          It's flexible enough to easily adapt to my meat consumption as well:

              range-end="2024-12-31"
              activity-data="2024-01-14"
              activity-levels="0,1"
          	first-day-of-week="1"
          	i18n='{"less":"🌱 No Meat","more":"🍖 Meat"}'
          ></activity-graph>

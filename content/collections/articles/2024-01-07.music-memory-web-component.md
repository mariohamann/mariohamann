      For Christmas, my wife's family has a charming tradition: we hand over our presents with a personal touch, like playing a game or doing a quest.

      This year, I've decided to add a twist to the classic Memory game, where you flip cards to find matching pictures. But in my version, you need to match pairs from the same **song**.

      This seemed like a weird enough use case for a web component... so here we are, proudly presenting the `<music-memory>` web component, which turns the following code into an (unstyled!) interactive memory card game:

      ```html
      <music-memory>
        <audio
          src="jingle-bells.mp3"
          data-range1="0-4580"
          data-range2="4580-9500"></audio>
        <audio
          src="joy-to-the-world.mp3"
          data-range1="0-5300"
          data-range2="5300-10000"></audio>
        <audio
          src="we-wish-you-a-merry-christmas.mp3"
          data-range1="0-5950"
          data-range2="5972-13000"></audio>
      </music-memory>
      ```

      You can grab the component from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/music-memory), have a look at [GitHub](https://github.com/mariohamann/music-memory) or try it out on the festive demo [website](https://mariohamann.github.io/music-memory/) or iFrame below:  ðŸ˜„

      Let me just give you a little bit of advice: Don't put to many songs into it. I did the game with 8 songs and it was an overwhelming mess. ðŸ˜‚

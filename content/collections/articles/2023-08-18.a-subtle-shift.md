title: 'A Subtle Shift'
markdown: |-
  Since joining Mastodon at the end of last year, I still appreciated Twitter as a way to keep up with news and trends in the web community. While I still miss especially a lot of Laravel people, something changed for me this week:

  I read several discussions. They weren't about the newest framework, the most powerful feature or the smartest algorithm. They weren't even all very friendly. But they were full of valuable perspectives from experienced people sharing their reasoned thoughts in more than 160 characters.

  In the past, Twitter has been a great motivator for me to play around, learn, and gain knowledge. But this week, Mastodon did so much more: It made me think and reflect.

  So... thanks to all of you motivating people!

      Having had some discussions this week, here my personal perspective on what "Quality in Web Development" means to me:

      1. 🤝 Accessibility: Equal access, regardless of disabilities or limited resources.
      2. ♻️ Sustainability: Efficient, simplified architecture and features.
      3. 😊 Enjoyability: Intuitive, appealing and valuable user experiences.
      4. 🫡 Trustworthiness: Respect for security, privacy and reliability.

      A few months ago I started developing a CLI to easily start a design system with Figma as the single source of truth for logos and icons. These assets were organized as components on a Figma page, and my goal for easy updates was to pull them programmaticaly into my project using Figma's API. My specific needs were:

      1. Download all logos as `.svg` and `.png` into `src/logos`.
      2. Download all icons (>2000!) into `src/icons`

      I aimed for this output:

      ```bash
      src
      │
      ├── logos
      │   ├── logo-stylized.svg
      │   ├── logo-stylized.png
      │   ├── logo-wordmark.png
      │   └── logo-wordmark.svg
      │
      └── icons
          ├── activity.svg
          ├── alarm.svg
          ├── alarm-fill.svg
          ├── ...
          ├── // other >2000 icons
          ├── ...
          └── zoom-out.svg
      ```

      I quickly found some Node packages, but there were bugs or missing features:

      1. [There wasn't an option to set multiple formats for specific assets.](https://github.com/tsimenis/figma-export-icons/issues/12)
      2. [It was impossible to ignore certain layers.](https://github.com/tsimenis/figma-export-icons/issues/20)
      3. [>400 requested exports exceeded Figma's Export API, but batching was not implemented.](https://github.com/tsimenis/figma-export-icons/issues/13)
      4. [There was no feature to customize file paths per asset.](https://github.com/tsimenis/figma-export-icons#description)

      I decided to take it into my own hands, forked [figma-export-icons](https://github.com/tsimenis/figma-export-icons), took some inspiration from [figma-assets-exporter](https://github.com/nate-summercook/figma-assets-exporter) and rewrote it to make it super customizable. 


      ## figma-export-assets

      The result `figma-export-assets` is of course available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mariohamann/figma-export-assets) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/figma-export-assets) – and I'm  actually quite happy with the functionality of the package (shamelessly copied from the docs):




      - 📄 **Multiple Figma Pages/Frames**: Configure to process assets from various Figma pages or specific frames.
      - 🔄 **Batch Exporting**: Supports batch exporting out of the box to overcame Figma API export limits.
      - 📁 **Customizable Asset Paths/Names**: Set unique saving paths or names for each asset.
      - 🌈 **Customizable Asset Format**: Chose any Figma export format for each asset.
      - 🚫 **Asset Exclusion**: Easily exclude specific assets from export based on their names.
      - ⚙️ **Axios Integration**: Extend or modify Axios configurations for advanced HTTP request handling.
      - 🌟 **Variant Exporting**: Overridable option to export components with variants as separate assets.

      Here’s how it works for my initial requirements:

      ```js
      require("dotenv").config({ path: ".env" });
      const { FigmaExporter } = require("figma-export-assets");

      // Helper function to optimize path coming from Figma
      const optimizePath = (path) =>
      		path.replace("assets/", "").replace("name=", "").replace(".png", "");

      async function main() {
      	// 0. Initialize exporter
      	const figma = new FigmaExporter({
      	    figmaPersonalToken: process.env.figma_token,
      	    fileId: process.env.figma_file_id,
      	    page: "📎 assets",
      	    assetsPath: "src",
          });

      	// 1. Get an array of all assets in the Figma file
      	let assets = await figma.getAssets();

      	// 2. Create PNGs from logos
      	let pngs = assets.filter((asset) => asset.name.includes("assets/logos"));
      	pngs = await figma.exportAssets(pngs, "png", 4);
      	const pngDownloads = pngs.map(async (asset) => {
      		await figma.saveAsset(asset, {
      			path: optimizePath(asset.name),
      		});
      		console.log(`Downloaded ${asset.name} as png`);
      	});
      	await Promise.all(pngDownloads);

      	// 3. Create SVGs from logos and icons
      	svgs = await figma.exportAssets(assets, "svg");
      	const svgDownloads = svgs.map(async (asset) => {
      		await figma.saveAsset(asset, {
      			name: optimizePath(asset.name),
      		});
      		console.log(`Downloaded ${asset.name} as svg`);
      	});
      	await Promise.all(svgDownloads);
      }

      // Run everything
      main();
      ```

      ## Broader usage

      Of course this isn't limited to just icons or logos –  It can be used with any imagery like photos, Open Graph images, illustrations etc., making it a nice tool to automize workflows between Figma and development.



      For my personal project it was just perfect, and to my delight, just a few weeks later it was implemented in one [Design System I'm part of](https://github.com/synergy-design-system/synergy-design-system/blob/main/packages/assets/scripts/fetch-assets.js). 🎉

      Looking forward to other usages – maybe yours? 😉

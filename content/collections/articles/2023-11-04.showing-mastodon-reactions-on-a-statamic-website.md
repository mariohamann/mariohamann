      A few weeks ago, I rebooted my website with the intention of publishing more content. To inject a bit more "interactivity" into it, I decided to display _Mastodon_ reactions related to my articles (likes, reposts, responses). Yesterday, I finally had the time to bring this feature to life.

      ## Part 1: Webmentions, webmention.io & brid.gy
      There are many articles how to implement webmentions utilizing _[brid.gy](https://brid.gy)_ and _[webmention.io](https://webmention.io)_.

      The process is more or less:
      1. Link your social media account to _brid.gy_, which scans for posts and reactions and notifies related websites that contain...
      2. ...a `<link rel="webmention" ...>` in their `<head>`, leading to a request on _webmention.io_, which then provides an API to fetch all those mentions.
      3. Developers pull data from the API for their desired use.

      Having performance and privacy in mind I implemented the following:
      1. A _Laravel_ command `webmentions:fetch` retrieves all webmentions from webmention.io and saves them as `{article-slug}.json` in local storage.
      2. A _Statamic_ tag `{{ webmentions :slug="slug" wm-property="like-of" }}` parses the corresponding JSON and filters for e. g. likes.
      3. A _Statamic_ modifier `{{ ... | remove_initial_mentions }}` that removes `@` mentions at the start of a post.
      4. A _Statamic_ modifier `{{ ... | initials:2 }}`, which returns the first letters of the specified number of words.
      5. A cron job on [ploi.io](https://ploi.io) that runs `webmentions:fetch` twice daily and regenerates my static pages.

      ## Part 2: Doubts About the Results

      There are several posts voicing concerns about _webmention.io_ and _brid.gy_. I thought I had optimized it well:
      1. I `.gitignore`d all generated JSONs, so the data isn't on _GitHub_ but only temporarily on my server.
      2. I handled fetching server-side, so my website visitors wouldn't need to connect to third-party APIs.
      3. I opted not to display avatars, using initials instead.

      However, once everything was in place and I saw the posts on my website, it didn't feel right.

      So here's my take on it:

      > Posts live in the context of their platform, and even if it's public, that context always matters.

      Interestingly, I've had read similar thoughts in [another article](https://www.brycewray.com/posts/2022/05/indieweb-experiment-ends/), but it seems I needed to experience it firsthand to realize that exposing people's reactions without their explicit consent goes against my fourth [principle for web development](/principles-for-web-development):

      > ðŸ«¡ Trustworthiness: Respect for security, privacy and reliability.

      ## Part 3: Mastodon API

      This morning I decided to replace initial my implementation and go a different route. I set up:

      1. An a _Array_ field in _Statamic_ blueprint for storing `id`, `replies_count`, `reblogs_count` and `favourites_count`.
      2. A _Laravel_ command to fetch the relevant _Mastodon_ API data for each post's `id`, updating the appropriate fields.
      3. A cron job on _Ploi.io_ to run the command regularly.

      This approach brought several technical advantages:
      - Optimized performance and a lighter setup.
      - Reduced dependency on third-party services, which by the way proved somewhat unreliable during my tests.
      - Tighter integration with how _Statamic_ operates, benefiting from its automatic cache invalidation.

      Feel free to check out the code yourself in this [commit on GitHub](https://github.com/mariohamann/mariohamann/commit/1acdc7e226da10c9a7cdcc365f0d2d47e6967aac).
